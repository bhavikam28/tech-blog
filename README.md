# TechNest by Bhavika â€” Automated DevOps Blog on AWS

This repository powers [technestbybhavika.com](https://technestbybhavika.com), a fully automated, secure, and scalable tech blog built using Hugo, GitHub Actions, Terraform, and AWS services.

The goal was to build a production-grade, low-maintenance blog platform that incorporates Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), CI/CD pipelines, and best practices for cloud security and performance.

## Architecture Overview

![Tech Blog DevOps Pipeline](./956d0f15-3513-4c6b-92bc-8c516a7fd798.png)

This architecture implements the following:

- Static blog content is built using Hugo.
- GitHub Actions triggers three CI/CD jobs: `infra_job`, `build_job`, and `deploy_job`.
- Terraform provisions AWS infrastructure using remote backend (HCP).
- GitHub and Terraform authenticate with AWS using OpenID Connect (OIDC) without long-lived credentials.
- Content is hosted on S3 and served securely via CloudFront with Origin Access Control (OAC).

---

## Features

- Static site generation using Hugo
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure provisioning via Terraform
- Secure, credential-less OIDC-based authentication
- Global content delivery using AWS CloudFront
- HTTPS with ACM SSL certificate
- Cache invalidation after every deployment
- Modular and scalable file structure

---

## Tech Stack

**Static Site Generator**  
- Hugo

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
- Terraform (with HCP as backend)

**CI/CD Automation**  
- GitHub Actions

**AWS Services**  
- S3 (static hosting)  
- CloudFront (CDN)  
- IAM (with OIDC role assumption)  
- ACM (SSL/TLS)  
- Route 53 (custom domain)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Hugo (extended version)
- Terraform

### Local Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhavikam28/tech-blog.git
cd tech-blog
hugo server -D

Visit: http://localhost:1313

Configuration

Edit hugo.toml:

Set baseURL to your domain

Update author name, social links, and profile image

Build & Deploy

Deployment is fully automated via GitHub Actions.

GitHub Workflow Overview

infra_job: Provisions infrastructure (S3, CloudFront, IAM roles, ACM)

build_job: Builds the static blog site with Hugo

deploy_job: Uploads files to S3 and invalidates CloudFront cache

OIDC is used for secure role assumption without hardcoded secrets.
