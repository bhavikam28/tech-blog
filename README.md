## Architecture Overview

![DevOps Architecture Diagram](./956d0f15-3513-4c6b-92bc-8c516a7fd798.png)

- **GitHub Actions Workflow** triggers on code push.
- Three jobs: `infra_job`, `build_job`, `deploy_job`.
- Uses **OIDC** for secure IAM role assumptions (GitHub & Terraform Cloud).
- AWS infra includes **S3 (static site)**, **CloudFront (CDN)**, and **ACM (SSL)**.
- **OAC** restricts S3 access to CloudFront only.

---

## Features

- Static site generation with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- Full CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Infra-as-Code using Terraform + HCP backend
- AWS S3 + CloudFront + ACM with OIDC-secured role assumptions
- SSL-enabled custom domain: [technestbybhavika.com](https://technestbybhavika.com)
- Clean and secure IAM roles, no long-lived credentials
- Reusable and modular Terraform code structure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Hugo Extended](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)
- [Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)

### Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhavikam28/tech-blog.git
cd tech-blog
hugo server -D
```

Visit: http://localhost:1313

Configuration

Edit hugo.toml:

Set baseURL = "https://technestbybhavika.com"

Update author name, social links, and profile image URL

Build & Deploy

Deployment is fully automated via GitHub Actions.

GitHub Workflow Overview

infra_job: Provisions infrastructure (S3, CloudFront, IAM roles, ACM)

build_job: Builds the static blog site with Hugo

deploy_job: Uploads files to S3 and invalidates CloudFront cache

OIDC is used for secure role assumption without hardcoded secrets.
